I grew up outside of Los Angeles, CA and studied physics at California State University, Northridge for my B.S. and M.S. There, I worked under the advisement of Dr. Tyler Luchko on computational physics research, employing various numerical methods for the thermodynamic modeling of microbiological systems. I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan in the department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. I study the feasibility of machine learning (ML) applications in simplified climate models. In particular, we look at the limits of emulating physical parameterizations in the context of simplified modeling frameworks in order to find the relationships between offline performance and degradation with respect to ML complexity, as well as the ability to couple optimized models back to the climate model.
