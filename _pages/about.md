Bio
-======
I grew up outside of Los Angeles, CA and studied physics at California State University, Northridge. I graduated from CSUN with my B.S. (2016) and M.S. (2018). While there, I worked under the advisement of Dr. Tyler Luchko on computational physics research. We employed various numerical methods for the thermodynamic modeling of microbiological systems. I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan in the department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. I study the feasibility of machine learning (ML) applications in simplified climate models. I recently moved from Ann Arbor, MI to the Boston (Cambridge, MA) area and will finish writing my thesis remotely. I have an anticipated doctoral defense date of mid-April, 2024.

Research Interests
-======
During my PhD program, I have been studying the limitations of machine learning (ML) applications for use as emulators within climate models.
